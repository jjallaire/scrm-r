scrm-r
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm-r.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scrm/scrm-r)

scrm as an R package. 


Status
======================
Basically working, but still under heavy development. Will be released on CRAN
once the `cran-release` target is hit.

Installation
======================
The development version can be installed from GitHub using
```
devtools::install_github('scrm/scrm-r')
```

Versioning
======================
We will stick to the sheme version `x.y-z`, where `x.y` is the version 
of _scrm_ included in the package, and `z` is the number of CRAN releases 
for this _scrm_ version, starting at `1` (`0` is used for development).
