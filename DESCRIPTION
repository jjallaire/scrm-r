Description: The Sequential Coalescent with Recombination Model (SCRM) is an
    approximation of the Ancestral Recombination Graph. It can be used to
    simulate the neutral evolution of chromosomes/biological sequences
    subject to possibly complicated population structure.
    The program scrm is an implementation of this model that is designed to
    act as an drop-in replacement for the widely adopted coalescent simulator
    ms. This package contains scrm along with a convinient R interface.
