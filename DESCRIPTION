Description: 
The Sequential Coalescent with Recombination Model (SCRM) is an 
approximation of the Ancestral Recombination Graph. It can be used to
simulate the neutral evolution of chromosomes/biological sequences
subject to possibly complicated population structure.
 
The program scrm is an implementation of this model that is designed to 
act as an drop-in replacement for the widely adopted coalescent simulator
ms. This package contains scrm along with a convinient R interface.
